# Investigate-Fandango-s-Movie-Rating
Is Fandangoo' rating inflated? 


In October 2015, a data journalist named Walt Hickey analyzed movie ratings data and found strong evidence to suggest that Fandango's rating system was biased and dishonest (Fandango is an online movie ratings aggregator). He published his analysis in this article â€” a great piece of data journalism that's totally worth reading.
The goal for this project is to determine whether there has been any change in Fandango's rating system after Hickey's analysis

raw data could be downloaded here,
Walt Hickey made the data he analyzed publicly available on GitHub. We'll use the data he collected to analyze the characteristics of Fandango's rating system previous to his analysis.

One of Dataquest's team members collected movie ratings data for movies released in 2016 and 2017. The data is publicly available on GitHub and we'll use it to analyze the rating system's characteristics after Hickey's analysis.
